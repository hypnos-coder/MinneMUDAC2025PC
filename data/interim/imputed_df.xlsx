They met together as a group and had strong family ties & match connections across the board. There were no child safety concerns. Since they were considered a Big Couple, Match Support was mostly done with Jeya and not much communication was done with B_first_name as the secondary Big in this match situation. In May of June 2019, they wanted to support their Little Rae?Kwon above and beyond the scope of the program but checked in with MEC prior to see if it would be possible within the program boundaries. MEC said, ?No? and Jeya said she would check to see if it would even be possible for the Homeless and Highly mobile transportation to pick Rae?Kwon at Jeya & B_first_name?s house. (They were going to have Rae?Kwon stay with them for a few weeks to help him focus better in school vs having to transition daily from a day shelter to a night shelter.) Jeya did not communicate back with MEC about whether they would move forward or not. MEC spoke with the kids and there was a miscommunication that led to immediate closure. MEC understood that Rae?Kwon was already staying with Jeya & B_first_name when he actually wasn?t. MEC closed the match immediately and then Jeya, B_first_name, and Marquita (mom) confirmed that Rae?Kwon was not actually staying with them and it didn?t work out to get transportation anyway. Manager of Match Engagement spoke to Bigs, MEC spoke to parents and all would like to continue with the program under BBBS guidelines including being treated as 2 separate matches in which both B_first_name and Jeya complete match support contacts separately.

With the adoption transition, they want someone who she can identify with and look up to. Because LS comes from a tougher background, moms do not want her perception of being Black tied with her mother's past thus reaching out to the program for the 1:1 role.

She understands what it means to not only be Black in the country, but also an immigrant. EMC believes both fill what the other are looking for in terms of making that impact. Another thing to note is the family has plans to move to CA in the next year or two, and BS is finishing her residency in MN around the same time (Summer 2020) and isn't sure what her plans are after -- she mentioned potentially moving back to NYC.
