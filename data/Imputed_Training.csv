Both took a little bit of time to warm up initially, but became very engaging and fun-loving. Shared Interests: socializing with friends, reading, active, arts/crafts.

With the adoption transition, they want someone who she can identify with and look up to. Because LS comes from a tougher background, moms do not want her perception of being Black tied with her mother's past thus reaching out to the program for the 1:1 role. BS is a independent, hard-working, driven black female. She is passionate about social justice, race, and providing guidance to young, black girls. She understands what it means to not only be Black in the country, but also an immigrant. EMC believes both fill what the other are looking for in terms of making that impact. Another thing to note is the family has plans to move to CA in the next year or two, and BS is finishing her residency in MN around the same time (Summer 2020) and isn't sure what her plans are after -- she mentioned potentially moving back to NYC.

Since they were considered a Big Couple, Match Support was mostly done with B_first_name and not much communication was done with Marek as the secondary Big in this match situation. In May of June 2019, they wanted to support their Little Rae?Kwon above and beyond the scope of the program but checked in with MEC prior to see if it would be possible within the program boundaries. MEC said, ?No? and B_first_name said she would check to see if it would even be possible for the Homeless and Highly mobile transportation to pick Rae?Kwon at B_first_name & Marek?s house. (They were going to have Rae?Kwon stay with them for a few weeks to help him focus better in school vs having to transition daily from a day shelter to a night shelter.) B_first_name did not communicate back with MEC about whether they would move forward or not. MEC spoke with the kids and there was a miscommunication that led to immediate closure. MEC understood that Rae?Kwon was already staying with B_first_name & Marek when he actually wasn?t. MEC closed the match immediately and then B_first_name, Marek, and Marquita (mom) confirmed that Rae?Kwon was not actually staying with them and it didn?t work out to get transportation anyway. Manager of Match Engagement spoke to Bigs, MEC spoke to parents and all would like to continue with the program under BBBS guidelines including being treated as 2 separate matches in which both Marek and B_first_name complete match support contacts separately.

She could empathize with L_first_name but may also know how to offer more encouragement and activity. L_first_name would be excited about her dog. BS is non-smoking. Additional Information: Per Program's most recent training concerning eating disorders, this is a match where sensitivity around this may come into play. P/G came across with the LS's interest at the heart of her comments but did note that LS's doctor has recommended that she lose weight and that activity is encouraged in the interview. P/G also stated that LS can get angry if her food portions are limited (again EMC believes P/G is trying to do what is best for her daughter and what had been recommended to her by her doctor). MEC may want to highlight to P/G and BS that while physical activity can be encouraged (as it's some of LS's favorite activities as well) that diet or weight talk as a goal or part of conversation should not take place in the match (obviously LS should not be in the room if this conversation is had).",555.0,21.0,576.0,Living w/ Significant Other,Female,2012-03-01,Hispanic - Other Latinx or Spanish origin,32.2
