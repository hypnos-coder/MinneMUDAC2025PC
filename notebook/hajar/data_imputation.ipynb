    "Considering the number of missing values found within the dataset a variety of imputation methods were considered to take care of data sparsity. To address this, key features of the data set were considered including the fact that feetures are highly correlated in addition to whether the data is missing at random, missing completley at random, or missing not at random. \n",
    "\n",
    "Missing Completely at Random, MCAR, means there is no relationship between the missingness of the data and any values, observed or missing. Those missing data points are a random subset of the data. There is nothing systematic going on that makes some data more likely to be missing than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing at Random, MAR, means there is a systematic relationship between the propensity of missing values and the observed data, but not the missing data. Whether an observation is missing has nothing to do with the missing values, but it does have to do with the values of an individualâ€™s observed variables. So, for example, if men are more likely to tell you their weight than women, weight is MAR.\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing Not at Random, MNAR, means there is a relationship between the propensity of a value to be missing and its values. This is a case where the people with the lowest education are missing on education or the sickest people are most likely to drop out of the study."
